# Tansekak — Product Specification

## 1. Purpose

Tansekak is an **admission eligibility checker** for Egyptian Thanaweya Amma graduates.

A student enters an academic track and a total score. The app compares those values to official cutoff scores for the **current published admission year** and lists university faculties the student is **eligible** for.

Students can also look up an imported Thanaweya result by seating number and see their rank among peers in the same track.

Results are **indicative only**. Egypt’s official electronic coordination portal decides final placement. Tansekak does not register preferences, allocate seats, or issue admission decisions.

## 2. Users

| User                     | Goal                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Student / parent         | Check which faculties a score is eligible for; look up a Thanaweya result and track rank; read a short coordination FAQ. |
| Operator / administrator | Publish the current admission year; maintain cutoffs (CRUD and Markdown import); import student results from Excel.      |
| Catalog maintainer       | Manage governorates, universities, faculties, and university–faculty links via API only (no admin UI).                   |

There is a single Identity role: **Administrator**. Public visitors are unauthenticated. Admin login is not linked from the public site.

---

### 6.1 Routes

| Route               | Page                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/`                 | Landing — overview and entry points        |
| `/predict`          | Track + score form                         |
| `/results`          | Eligible faculties (paginated, searchable) |
| `/thanaweya-result` | Seating-number result lookup               |
| `/track-rank`       | Seating lookup with track rank among peers |
| `/guide`            | Static coordination FAQ                    |
| `/designer`         | Developer / credits page                   |

Unknown paths redirect to `/`.

### 6.2 Prediction

**Request:** academic track and total score. The API uses the **current published** admission year (`IsCurrent`). Score must not exceed that year’s `MaximumScore`.

**Eligibility (must all hold):**

1. Cutoff belongs to the current year.
2. Student score **≥** cutoff score (eligible only).
3. Cutoff track is in the student’s Science or Literature **bucket**.
4. Faculty `AllowedTracks` matches the student’s canonical track.

**Sort:** `abs(score − cutoff)` ascending (closest eligible cutoff first). Duplicate university–faculty rows are collapsed to one result.

**Pagination:**

| Layer    | Page size                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | `pageSize` **20**, unlimited load-more (and show-all remaining pages) |
| API      | Default **10**, maximum **100**                                       |

**Search:** client-side filter of **already loaded** rows by university or faculty `NameAr`. Search does not query the server.

Until cutoffs exist for the current year, prediction returns an empty list.

### 6.3 Thanaweya lookup and track rank

Both `/thanaweya-result` and `/track-rank` look up `GET /api/thanaweya-results/{seatingNo}` for the **current** admission year.

When a row exists, the API returns seating number, Arabic name, total degree, student case, inferred/canonical track, track rank, and track cohort size when rank can be computed.

**Rank rule:** among students in the same canonical track, **higher score ranks better**; ties are broken by **lower seating number**.

Lookup returns not found when the seating number is missing for the current year.

---

## 7. Academic tracks

Public UI and `GET /api/config` expose **two** tracks:

| API value    | Arabic label   |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `Science`    | الشعبة العلمية |
| `Literature` | الشعبة الأدبية |

The domain enum still has `Mathematics = 2`. Mathematics is **canonicalized to Science everywhere** (prediction, import, rank, labels, `AllowedTracks` matching).

The **Science bucket** includes stored `Science` and `Mathematics` cutoff/result rows. Literature is its own bucket.

---

## 8. Admin product

Authentication is **cookie-based ASP.NET Core Identity** with the **Administrator** role.

| Route                   | Capability                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/admin/login`          | Sign in (not linked from public)                                     |
| `/admin`                | Dashboard                                                            |
| `/admin/years`          | Create, edit, and delete the single admission year                   |
| `/admin/cutoffs`        | CRUD for the **current year only** (API may filter by `yearId`)      |
| `/admin/import`         | Science and/or Literature `.md` for the **current year**             |
| `/admin/import-results` | `.xlsx` for the **current year**; replaces all results for that year |

Import pages show a progress overlay. Navigation away is **blocked** until the import finishes or the operator confirms leaving.

### 8.1 Dashboard

Shows the current year plus counts for:

- governorates
- universities
- faculties
- university–faculties
- student results

The dashboard API also returns `cutoffsCount`. The UI **does not display** it.

### 8.2 Admission years

Only **one** admission year may exist at a time.

- Create when no year exists; new rows are marked `IsCurrent = true`.
- A second create while any year exists returns `ADMISSION_YEAR_LIMIT_REACHED`.
- Edit year number and maximum score (`IsCurrent` is unchanged).
- Delete cascades cutoffs, student results, and import jobs for that year.
- To switch cycles: delete the current year, then create the new one.
- Year range: **2000–2100**. Maximum score: **0.01–1000**, default **320**. Duplicate calendar year is rejected.
- Prediction, public lookup, and the admin import UI all use the current year (`IsCurrent`).

### 8.3 Cutoffs

Admin UI lists/creates/updates/deletes cutoffs for the current year. University and faculty dropdowns come from the existing catalog. Cutoffs are the only catalog-adjacent records the UI can delete.

### 8.4 API-only catalog (no UI)

These have admin API endpoints (GET/POST/PUT, no delete) and no SPA pages:

- Governorates
- Universities
- Faculties
- University–faculties

## 9. Data model (summary)

Business entities use **integer IDs** allocated by `EntityIdAllocator` / `EntityIdSequence`. ASP.NET Identity tables use **PostgreSQL identity columns**. `ImportJob` uses a **Guid** primary key.

| Entity                | Role                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Governorate**       | Egyptian governorate (`NameAr`)                                                       |
| **University**        | `NameAr`, `GovernorateId`, `Type` = `Public` (1) or `Institute` (2)                   |
| **Faculty**           | `NameAr`, `AllowedTracks` (JSON list of academic tracks)                              |
| **UniversityFaculty** | Links a university to a faculty; cutoffs hang off this pair                           |
| **AdmissionYear**     | Calendar year, `MaximumScore`, `IsCurrent`                                            |
| **AdmissionCutoff**   | Year + university–faculty + track + `CutoffScore`                                     |
| **StudentResult**     | Year + seating no, Arabic name, total degree, case description, optional stored track |
| **ImportJob**         | Async Excel import status (`queued` / `running` / `completed` / `failed`)             |
| **EntityIdSequence**  | Next integer ID per entity name                                                       |

**Relationships (high level):**

```
Governorate 1──* University 1──* UniversityFaculty *──1 Faculty
AdmissionYear 1──* AdmissionCutoff *──1 UniversityFaculty
AdmissionYear 1──* StudentResult
AdmissionYear 1──* ImportJob
```

Uniqueness that matters in operations: one calendar year value; cutoffs are replaced per year+track on Markdown import; student results are replaced per year on Excel import.

---

## 10. Bootstrap and seeding

On startup the API applies EF migrations, then:

1. **Catalog seed (once):** if `Governorates` is empty, load JSON from `SeededData/` (`Governorates`, `Universities`, `Faculties`, `UniversityFaculties`). After that, the database is the source of truth.
2. **Admission year:** create year **2027**, max score **320**, `IsCurrent = true`.
3. **Admin user:** from `AdminSeed` (`AdminSeed__Email` / `AdminSeed__Password`). Development defaults are rejected at startup outside Development.

**Cutoffs are not seeded.** Sample files:

- `SeededData/cutoffs/science-2026.md`
- `SeededData/cutoffs/literature-2026.md`

**2026** is the official source cycle in those files. The operator attaches them to the **CURRENT** year (bootstrap default **2027**) via `/admin/import`. Files are uploaded from a **local clone**; they are **not** in the Docker image.

Student workbooks are not stored in the repo.

---

## 11. Import

Admin imports target the **current** admission year only. There is no preview step: a file is validated, then applied in full or rejected in full.

- **Cutoffs:** Science and/or Literature Markdown (`.md`, max 10 MB). Pipe table with **الكلية** / **الحد الأدنى**. Each file replaces that track for the current year (Science import also clears legacy `Mathematics` rows).
- **Student results:** Excel (`.xlsx`) with columns `seating_no`, `arabic_name`, `total_degree`, `student_case_desc`. Replaces all results for the current year. Direct upload ≤ 20 MB; larger files use Cloudflare R2 and an async job.

Any validation error rejects the entire file. Import endpoints and error codes: **[docs/API.md](API.md)**.

---

## 12. API contract

JSON responses use a standard envelope (`success`, `message`, `errorCode`, `data`, `errors`). Failures return Arabic messages and stable error codes. `GET /health` is unwrapped. Admin auth is cookie-based Identity (role `Administrator`).

Public surface: `GET /api/config`, `POST /api/admission/predict`, `GET /api/thanaweya-results/{seatingNo}`. Admin covers dashboard, catalog CRUD (no delete except cutoffs), admission year CRUD (single year), cutoffs, imports, and import jobs.

Full HTTP contract, status codes, and error catalog: **[docs/API.md](API.md)**.

In production the API serves the Angular build from `wwwroot/` and falls back to `index.html` for client routes. Local Development uses CORS to `http://localhost:4200`. Production SPA and API share one origin.

## 13. Stack and architecture

| Layer          | Technology                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| API            | ASP.NET Core 10                       |
| Data           | EF Core, PostgreSQL, Npgsql           |
| Frontend       | Angular 19 standalone, RTL            |
| Validation     | FluentValidation                      |
| Excel          | ClosedXML                             |
| Object storage | Cloudflare R2 (optional; large Excel) |
| Tests          | xUnit                                 |

**Clean Architecture** projects: `Tansekak.Domain`, `Tansekak.Application`, `Tansekak.Infrastructure`, `Tansekak.Api`.

Application layer is **service interfaces + DTOs**. There is **no MediatR** and **no repository layer**. Infrastructure services use `AppDbContext` directly. Domain entities are anemic POCOs.

---

## 14. Deployment

One Docker monolith on Render (API + SPA), Neon PostgreSQL, optional Cloudflare R2 for large Excel imports. GitHub Actions runs build + tests; Render auto-deploys on push to `main`.

Checklist, env vars, and first-boot sequence: **[docs/DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

---

## 15. Tests

| Project                         | In `Tansekak.sln` / CI | Coverage                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tansekak.Application.Tests`    | Yes                    | Track rules, Arabic error catalog, related helpers                                                                |
| `Tansekak.Infrastructure.Tests` | Yes                    | Prediction, admission year rules, import, seeded Markdown parse, connection resolution                            |
| `Tansekak.Api.Tests`            | **No**                 | Exists on disk (`GlobalExceptionHandler`); **not** in the solution, so `dotnet test Tansekak.sln` does not run it |

There are no integration or end-to-end test projects.

---

## 16. Success criteria (current stage)

The product is successful for this stage when:

- A student can get an **eligible-only** faculty list for the published year, filtered by track and `AllowedTracks`, sorted by closest cutoff.
- A student can look up an imported result by seating number and see track rank when data exists.
- An operator can manage the admission year, import Science/Literature Markdown, import Excel results, and CRUD current-year cutoffs.
- Failures return Arabic catalog messages and stable error codes; health is a raw probe; auth is cookies.
- Fresh databases bootstrap catalog + 2027 current year + admin, and predictions stay empty until cutoffs are imported.
