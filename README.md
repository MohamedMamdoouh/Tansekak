# Tansekak

**Vibe coded project** — built iteratively with AI-assisted development.

Tansekak is an admission eligibility checker for Egyptian Thanaweya Amma graduates. Students pick a track and total score; the app lists faculties they are eligible for against the **current published** admission year.

Students can also look up a stored Thanaweya result by seating number and see their track rank among peers (when matching rows exist in the database).

Results are **indicative only**. Egypt’s official coordination portal decides final placement.

## Features

### Public (RTL Arabic)

Public chrome brand is **Tansekak**. API `appName` is `tansekak`. Admin chrome is **Admin**. A signed-in administrator also sees a dashboard link in the public header.

| Feature            | Route               | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Landing            | `/`                 | Overview and entry points                         |
| College prediction | `/predict`          | Track + score form (navigates to `/results`)      |
| Prediction results | `/results`          | Eligible faculties, client-side search, load-more |
| Thanaweya lookup   | `/thanaweya-result` | Result by seating number (current year)           |
| Track rank         | `/track-rank`       | Rank among the same track (percentile in UI)      |
| Coordination guide | `/guide`            | Static FAQ                                        |
| Developer profile  | `/designer`         | Credits                                           |

**Prediction**

- `/predict` collects track + score and navigates to `/results?track=&score=`.
- `/results` calls `POST /api/admission/predict` with `pageSize: 20`.
- Eligible only: `student score >= cutoff`.
- Current published year, matching track, and faculty `AllowedTracks`.
- Sorted closest cutoff first (`abs(score − cutoff)`).
- Unlimited load-more. API default page size is 10, max 100.
- Search filters **already loaded** university/faculty names (client-side).

**Tracks:** `Science`, `Mathematics`, `Literature`. Each is distinct for prediction, cutoffs, faculty eligibility, and track rank.

**Thanaweya lookup / track rank**

- Both pages call `GET /api/thanaweya-results/{seatingNo}` for the current year.
- There is **no admin import API** for student results at this stage. Rows must already exist in `StudentResults`.
- Track rank percentile is computed in the Angular UI from `trackRank` and `trackTotalStudents`.

### Admin

Sign in at `/admin/login` (not linked from the public site until an administrator is already signed in).

| Page             | Route           | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard        | `/admin`        | Current year plus governorate, faculty-type, and student-result counts                               |
| Admission years  | `/admin/years`  | Create, edit, delete the single admission year                                                       |
| Cutoffs          | `/admin/cutoffs`| CRUD for the **current** year                                                                        |
| Import cutoffs   | `/admin/import` | One Markdown file per track; each import replaces that track for the current year                    |

The dashboard also shows a **disabled** card for “استيراد نتائج الثانوية” (Excel student import). There is no `/admin/import-results` route and no backend import API — the card is a placeholder for a future feature.

The cutoff import page blocks navigation with a progress overlay until the upload finishes or you confirm leaving.

**Development admin** (rejected in Production): `admin@tansekak.local` / `Admin@12345`. Production uses `AdminSeed__Email` and `AdminSeed__Password`.

**API-only** (no UI): governorates, universities, faculties, university–faculties.

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend       | ASP.NET Core 10, EF Core 10, PostgreSQL (Npgsql), Identity cookies |
| Frontend      | Angular 19 standalone, RTL                                       |
| Validation    | FluentValidation                                                 |
| Tests         | xUnit (70 tests across 3 projects)                               |
| CI            | GitHub Actions (Angular production build + `dotnet test` solution) |
| Deploy        | Docker monolith on Render, Neon Postgres                         |

Clean Architecture: `Domain` → `Application` (services + DTOs, no MediatR, no repositories) → `Infrastructure` → `Api`. Integer business IDs use `EntityIdAllocator`; Identity tables use PostgreSQL identity columns.

**Removed from current stage:** student Excel import, async `ImportJob` queue, Cloudflare R2 storage.

## Prerequisites

**Local:** .NET 10 SDK, Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16+ (or Neon).

**Production:** Neon Postgres, Render web service.

---

## Quick start (local)

### 1. Database

Default connection in `src/Tansekak.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:

```
Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=Tansekak;Username=postgres;Password=postgres
```

### 2. API

```powershell
cd src/Tansekak.Api
dotnet run
```

- `http://localhost:5080`
- Health: `/health` → `{ "status": "healthy" }`
- OpenAPI (Development only): `/openapi/v1.json` (no Swagger UI)
- Startup (non-test): production guards, EF migrations, catalog seed if empty, faculty `AllowedTracks` repair, Mathematics track repair on existing student rows, cutoff bootstrap for empty tracks, bootstrap year **2027** (max 320, current), admin user

### 3. Frontend

```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

- `http://localhost:4200` (proxies `/api` and `/health` to `:5080`)

### 4. Cutoffs

On every startup, tracks with **zero** cutoffs in the current year are imported from `SeededData/cutoffs/` (build output `SeedData/cutoffs/`). Existing cutoffs are never overwritten.

Local `dotnet run` copies those files, so a fresh database typically has Science, Mathematics, and Literature cutoffs after first boot.

| File | Track |
| --- | --- |
| `SeededData/cutoffs/science-2026.md` | Science |
| `SeededData/cutoffs/mathematics-2026.md` | Mathematics |
| `SeededData/cutoffs/literature-2026.md` | Literature |

`2026` is the official source cycle. Rows attach to the **current published year** (bootstrap **2027**). Re-import or replace a track from `/admin/import`.

Docker images may omit these Markdown files (`.dockerignore` excludes `*.md`). See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).

---

## Production

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md).

| Layer     | Provider                                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App + SPA | Render Docker web service (`0.0.0.0:$PORT`)                     |
| Database  | Neon (`ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` or `DATABASE_URL`) |

Do **not** set `Frontend__Origin` in production — SPA and API share one origin.

---

## Configuration

| Key                                   | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` | Npgsql keyword string, or use `DATABASE_URL`          |
| `Tansekak:AppName`                    | Returned by `/api/config`                             |
| `AdminSeed:Email` / `Password`        | First-run admin                                       |
| `Frontend:Origin`                     | CORS for local Angular (`http://localhost:4200`) only |
| `Testing:SkipStartupSeed`             | Test host only — skips startup seeding                |
| `Testing:UseSqlite`                   | Test host only — in-memory SQLite instead of Npgsql   |

Production rejects localhost connection strings and the dev admin credentials. No object-storage env vars are required.

---

## Database

Seeded once when `Governorates` is empty: `Governorates.json`, `Universities.json`, `Faculties.json`, `UniversityFaculties.json`, plus admission year **2027**. After that the database is the source of truth for catalog rows.

Every startup still:

- Repairs `Faculties.AllowedTracks` from seed JSON when they diverge.
- Repairs `StudentResults` rows whose Mathematics track was collapsed to Science (migration-era data fix).
- Imports seed Markdown for any current-year track that has zero cutoffs.

Entities: Governorate, University (`Public` / `Institute`), Faculty (`AllowedTracks`), UniversityFaculty, AdmissionYear, AdmissionCutoff, StudentResult, EntityIdSequence.

EF migrations apply automatically on startup. Latest migrations include `CollapseMathematicsIntoScience` (data repair) and `DropImportJobs` (removes unused import-job table).

Student results are **not seeded** and have **no admin write API** in the current stage.

---

## API and import

Envelope: `{ success, message, errorCode?, data, errors? }`. Failures use a stable `errorCode` and Arabic `message`. Success default message is English. `/health` is not wrapped.

Auth is **cookie Identity**, role `Administrator`.

**Import (current stage):** Markdown cutoff import only — `POST /api/admin/admission-years/{yearId}/import`.

Full contract: [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

---

## Testing

```powershell
dotnet test Tansekak.sln --configuration Release
```

CI runs an Angular production build, then that command. **70 tests** across Application, Infrastructure, and Api projects: track rules, prediction, admission year rules, Thanaweya lookup, Mathematics track repair, seeded Markdown parse, connection resolution, HTTP integration. There are no E2E or Angular unit-test projects.

---

## Building for production manually

```powershell
docker build -t tansekak .
docker run -p 8080:8080 `
  -e ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=...;SSL Mode=Require" `
  -e AdminSeed__Email="admin@example.com" `
  -e AdminSeed__Password="your-strong-password" `
  tansekak
```

Or without Docker: `npm ci` + production Angular build, `dotnet publish` the API, copy `client/dist/client/browser/*` into `publish/wwwroot`.

---

## Disclaimer

Tansekak uses official cutoff lists to estimate eligibility. It does not replace Egypt’s electronic coordination portal. Actual admission depends on demand, seats, preference order, and official rules for the current cycle.
